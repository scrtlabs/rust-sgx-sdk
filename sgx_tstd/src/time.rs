/// Instants are always guaranteed, barring [platform bugs], to be no less than any previously
/// measured instant when created, and are often useful for tasks such as measuring
/// benchmarks or timing how long an operation takes.
///
/// Note, however, that instants are **not** guaranteed to be **steady**. In other
/// words, each tick of the underlying clock might not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.
///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is
/// no method to get "the number of seconds" from an instant. Instead, it only
/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
///
/// The size of an `Instant` struct may vary depending on the target operating
/// system.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
/// use std::thread::sleep;
///
/// fn main() {
///    let now = Instant::now();
///
///    // we sleep for 2 seconds
///    sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));
///    // it prints '2'
///    println!("{}", now.elapsed().as_secs());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [platform bugs]: Instant#monotonicity
///
/// # OS-specific behaviors
///
/// An `Instant` is a wrapper around system-specific types and it may behave
/// differently depending on the underlying operating system. For example,
/// the following snippet is fine on Linux but panics on macOS:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::time::{Instant, Duration};
///
/// let now = Instant::now();

/// or operating system bugs. To work around these bugs and platforms not offering monotonic clocks
/// [`duration_since`], [`elapsed`] and [`sub`] saturate to zero. In older Rust versions this
/// lead to a panic instead. [`checked_duration_since`] can be used to detect and handle situations
/// where monotonicity is violated, or `Instant`s are subtracted in the wrong order.
///
/// This workaround obscures programming errors where earlier and later instants are accidentally
/// swapped. For this reason future rust versions may reintroduce panics.

/// save another file to the file system, **and the second file has a
